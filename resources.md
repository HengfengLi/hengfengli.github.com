#### Books, tutorials, and online courses


01. "Programming Pearls 2nd Edition" - Jon Bentley 
[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Pearls-2nd-Edition-Bentley/dp/0201657880)
[**My comments:** A great classic book about programming. I read it completely 
before my Microsoft interview, and it helps a lot. As the author suggests, 
you need to read it slowly and think about its exercises.]

02. "Writing Solid Code 1st Edition" - Steve Maguire 
[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Solid-Microsoft-Programming-Series/dp/1556155514)
[**My comments:** I really like his writing style and word usage - simple and 
elegant. It is an excellent book to read. I need to learn how to write 
like the author. This book was written in 1993, but recently the author
published the 2nd ed. in 2013 after 20 years.]
