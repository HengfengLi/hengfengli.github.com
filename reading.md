### Books that I read in 2018

* Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann
  * My comment: I think this is probably the best book that I read in 2017 (I started reading it since the end of 2017). It covers a lot of theoretical details in distributed systems. If you read this book first, then it saves a lot of efforts when you study techniques, such as distributed storage and consensus algorithms. Also, this book gives you a better understanding about why these frameworks are doing this and what problems they are trying to solve. Some parts are not easy to read and understand for me. But it is worth reading if you would like to dive into the world of distributed systems.
* Big Data: Principles and best practices of scalable realtime data systems by Nathan Marz
  * I learned some good ideas and concepts from this book:
    * Maintain an immutable master data store
    * All views can be inferred from the master data store
    * Have the ability to reprocess data to resolve data corruption
    caused by bugs and human errors
    * The logic of batch processing is simple
    * Keep an update-to-date view requires random writes and make things complex
  * Lambda architecture is very interesting, but I feel that there are two big
  troubles: maintaining two views is complicated and running batch processing
  on master data store regularly is expensive.
