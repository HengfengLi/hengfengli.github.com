__Problem:__ Given a trie (prefix tree), implement insertion and deletion 
of a word. 

                        Root
            /             |            \
            A             I            T
            |          /    \      /   |    \
            #         N      S    A    H     O
                      |      |    |    |      \
                      #      #    V    E       W
                                  |    | \     |
                                  E    R  #    N
                                  |    |       |
                                  R    E       #
                                  |    |
                                  N    #
                                  |
                                  #

__Input__:

word: a string "[a-z]\*". 

__Output__:

- insert(word)
- delete(word)

__Definition of a TrieNode (TreeNode):__ 

~~~ python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, ch):
        self.val = ch
        self.children = [None]*27 # [0..25] are [a..z], [26] is for '#'.
~~~

<br />

__Insertion (recursive):__

1) If "", reach the end of target word, and insert '#' for representing 
that there is a word ending here. 

2) If not "", 

- 2.a) if child word[0] doesn't exist. Create a new one. 
- 2.b) Insert word[1:] to the word[0]'s subtree. 

<br />

__Deletion (recursive):__

1) What should be deleted? a node without any child (including '#'). 

2) Where to delete? Node's parent. A parent should get a return 
value to know whether or not it should delete that node. 

Check whether a node should be deleted. 

~~~ python
for child in root.children:
    if child != None:
        return False
return True
~~~

If target word is "", then clean '#'. So that there is not a word anymore. 

~~~ python
if not word:
    root.children[-1] = None
~~~

If target word is not empty, then decide whether we can delete child word[0].

~~~ python
ind = ord(word[0])-ord('a')
# the node exist, delete this node
if root.children[ind] and detele(root.children[ind], word[1:]):
    root.children[ind] = None
~~~

__Deletion (iterative):__

![](https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1511/25153304272_b019762325.jpg)

The iterative version is to use a stack, which stores the travel path. 
Then, it recursively deletes a pop-out node's child, e.g., we delete 
'#' for 'E' and 'E'
for 'H'. 

If 'H' can be popped out from the stack, it means that 'E' can be deleted 
because it a null node with no children after deleting '#'. If 'E' has any 
other children than '#', then we break the deleting loop. We shouldn't 
delete 'E' because it is a part of another word. 

The code is as follows: 

~~~ python
def delete_iterative(root, word):
    """
    Iterative version: use stack. 
        1) put the path into a stack.
        2) pop out and delete its child. 
        3) check whether or not we can delete this node. 
    """
    stack = [root]
    ptr = root
    for ch in word:
        ind = ord(ch)-ord('a')
        if ptr.children[ind]:
            stack.append(ptr.children[ind])
            ptr = ptr.children[ind]
        else:
            # not exist
            return
    
    n = len(stack) # = len(word)+1
    for i in xrange(n):
        ptr = stack.pop()
        
        if i == 0:
            ind = -1 # for '#'
        else:
            ind = ord(word[len(word)-i])-ord('a')
        
        ptr.children[ind] = None
        
        for child in ptr.children:
            if child:
                return
~~~

<br />

__Complete solution (recursively):__

~~~ python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, ch):
        self.val = ch
        self.children = [None]*27
    
def insert(root, word):
    if not word:
        root.children[-1] = '#'
        return # easy to forget
    
    ind = ord(word[0])-ord('a')
    
    if not root.children[ind]:
        root.children[ind] = TreeNode(word[0])
    
    insert(root.children[ind], word[1:])

def detele(root, word):
    if not word:
        # We reach the end of target word:
        # e.g. "the" or "ther", to remove '#'. 
        root.children[-1] = None
    else:
        # not reach the end. 
        ind = ord(word[0])-ord('a')
        # the node exist, delete this node
        if root.children[ind] and detele(root.children[ind], word[1:]):
            root.children[ind] = None
    
    # answer whether or not this node can be removed. 
    for child in root.children:
        if child != None:
            return False
    return True


def get_all(root, word, all_words):
    
    if root.children[-1] == '#':
        all_words.append(word)
    
    for i in range(26):
        if root.children[i] != None:
            new_word = word + root.children[i].val
            get_all(root.children[i], new_word, all_words)
    
    
root = TreeNode(None)

insert(root, "a")
insert(root, "in")
insert(root, "is")
insert(root, "tavern")
insert(root, "the")
insert(root, "there")
insert(root, "town")

words = []
get_all(root, "", words)
print words

words = []
detele(root, "ie")
detele(root, "ther")
detele(root, "there")
get_all(root, "", words)
print words

There are two questions on Leetcode relate to Trie: 
[208. Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-trie-prefix-tree/)
and
[211. Add and Search Word - Data structure design](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-and-search-word-data-structure-design/).

In addition, Chapter 5.2 (page 730) in the Algorithms 4th introduces
the Trie.
