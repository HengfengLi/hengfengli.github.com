This all starts with an idea that I'd like to run unit tests whenever a pull
request or a commit to a pull request is created.

I thought a bit to directly write a build server which listens for GitHub
webhooks. However, I think it's better to use an existing tool like Jenkins
or AWS CodePipeline for visualizing, monitoring and easy-to-maintain.

I had a look at CodePipeline, but it only listens to changes of a branch
instead of commits in a pull request like what TravisCI does. I probably can
use API Gateway and Lambda to implement, but Jenkins seems to be a more
sophisticated tool to learn.

Honestly, my first impression is that Jenkins's UI is really Java-style
(not looking very nice). I will use one of my previous repo in this demo,
[https://github.com/HengfengLi/pymapplot](https://github.com/HengfengLi/pymapplot).

# Workflow

The workflow should be as the following diagram:

![Workflow](/assets/img/hl-28-jenkins-github-chart.png){:width="50%"}


1. Developers create a pull request and push local branch to GitHub.
2. GitHub post a request to Jenkins's webhook endpoint.
3. Jenkins pulls latest code from GitHub to local directory.
4. Jenkins builds or tests code.
5. Jenkins informs GitHub about building/testing results.

# Steps

# 1. Run Jenkins with docker

Run the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v {YourHostPath}/jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home jenkins/jenkins
```

If you want to persist configurations and plugins, you need to map a volume
from host to container `/var/jenkins_home`.

You will see a password in console and copy it in somewhere for next step.

# 2. Setup Jenkins

1. Go to `http://localhost:8080`
2. Input the saved password or you can find the password in `/var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword`
3. Choose `Install suggested plugins`
4. Create a new admin
5. Go to `Manage Jenkins`
6. Click `Configure Global Security`
7. Choose `Safe HTML` in `Markup Formatter` dropdown menu (HTML will be displayed
  in `Build History` instead of plain text).

# 3. Install plugins

1. Visit `Manage Jenkins` and then `Manage Plugins`
2. Find `GitHub Pull Request Builder` plugin
3. Install without restart

# 4. Configure Jenkins

1. Visit `Manage Jenkins` and then `Configure System`
2. Find `GitHub Pull Request Builder` section
3. Input Jenkins's url to `Jenkins URL override` field. I use `ngrok` to
expose my local port for testing, so it is a url like `https://XXXXXXXXX.ngrok.io`
4. Click `Add` button next to `Credentials`, then choose `Jenkins`
5. In `Kind`, choose `Secret text`
6. Input your GitHub access token (with `repo` and `admin:repo_hook` permissions) in
`Secret` field
7. Type `jenkins-global` in `Description` field (this is an option name).
8. Click `Add`
9. Update `Description` in `GitHub Pull Request Builder` section
10. Add GitHub username into `Admin list`
11. Save the changes

# 5. Configure GitHub webhooks

Add webhool url in GitHub repository
1. Go the repository
2. Click `Settings`, click `Webhooks`, add `webhook`
3. Type `https://XXXXXXXXX.ngrok.io/ghprbhook/` in `Payload URL`
4. Choose `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` in `Content type`
5. Choose `Let me select individual events`
6. Choose `Pull requests`, `Pushes`, `Issue comments`
7. Click `Add webhook`

Enable Jenkins GitHub plugin service
1. Go the repository
2. Click `Settings`, click `Integrations & services`
3. Click `Add service`
4. Choose `Jenkins GitHub plugin`
5. Type `https://XXXXXXXXX.ngrok.io/github-webhook/` in `Jenkins hook url`
6. Click `Add service`

# 6. Create a project

1. Go to Jenkins's homepage
2. Click `New Item`
3. Type `pull-request-demo` in name
4. Choose `Freestyle project`
5. Click `OK`

# 7. Configure the project

General
1. Tick `GitHub project`
2. Type your project url like `https://github.com/HengfengLi/pymapplot` in `Project url`

Source Code Management
1. Click `Git`
2. Type `https://github.com/HengfengLi/pymapplot.git` in `Repository URL`
3. Click `Advanced`
4. Type `origin` in `Name`
5. Type `+refs/pull/*:refs/remotes/origin/pr/*` in `Refspec`

Build Triggers
1. Tick `GitHub Pull Request Builder`
2. Tick `Use github hooks for build triggering`

Build
1. Click `Add build step`
2. Choose `Execute shell`
3. Type the testing command `python -m unittest discover tests`

# 8. Build now

![Workflow](/assets/img/hl-28-build-job-scheduled.png){:width="30%"}

1. Go to the project homepage
2. Click `Build Now`
3. You can see a job has been scheduled (see above figure)
4. You can also check the following console log:

```bash

# Summary

Yes, so many configurations. There are still many plugins and configurations
that can be explored. This is just a "hello world" example.

There are some further questions:

* How to ensure the security?
  * I'd like to ensure only corporate
network can access the admin portal, but I also want to expose the webhook endpoints.
* How to build docker images inside a Jenkins container?
* How to deploy code to AWS ECS or Beanstalk?

It's really nice to have such a small feature to check every commit of your
pull request, adding lint checking and unit tests. This can really improve
codebase's quality and encourage to write more tests.
