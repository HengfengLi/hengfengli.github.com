Submit your entry: Once students have completed the online registration form, the Sponsor will provide a mainframe user ID (to enable students to complete the tasks for the contest) within 5 business days of registration (which begins on 1 Aug 2011). System resources are finite for this contest and will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. If sufficient system resources do not exist, the entrant will not be allowed to compete in the contest. For Parts 1 and 2 of the contest, students submit entries by transmitting data sets to an IBM user ID on the mainframe, as described in the contest instructions. Contestants must submit an entry for Part 1 before they submit an entry for Part 2. 


To enter Part 3, after completion of Part 1 & Part 2, students must send an email to adlz@au1.ibm.com by midnight on 1 Oct 2011. Students will receive a new user ID for Part 3. Contest judges (as described in Rule #6) will log into the student's account for Part 3 to verify the completion of Part 3 tasks; no formal submission of datasets needs to be made.
