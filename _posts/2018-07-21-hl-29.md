## Context and problem

This is used to partition a set of elements into a number of disjoint sets.

For example,

```bash
# a set of elements
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

# some elements are connected
(1,2)
(2,5)
(2,6)
(8,6)
(3,4)

# partitioned into disjoint subsets
[[1,2,5,6,8], [3,4], [7]]
```

## Solution

We can use union-find to solve this problem. Basically, we create a forest (a set of trees), which each tree is a disjoint set.
It has two operations: `union` and `find`.

* `find` returns the root of current element, which follows the chain
of parent pointers until reaching the root element.
* `union` connects two elements if their roots are different.

1. Initially, every element's parent is itself.
2. When two elements
are connected, we use `find` to figure out their roots at first.
3. If their roots are different, we merge two roots to make them become
a single tree.

## Issues and considerations

* Height of trees can grow as `O(n)`.
* Unbalanced tree increases the time of `find`.
* Two ways: merging by height (rank) or size of trees.

## When to use this algorithm

This algorithm is used for finding disjoint sets. Even if the problem is
defined in 2D, we can use an array to represent the data and
apply this algorithm. 

## Example

* Leetcode `#200`

```ruby
# ruby version
def find(a, x)
    pts = x

    while a[pts] != pts
        pts = a[pts]
    end

    return pts
end

def generate_input(test_data)
    test_data.split('\n').map { |item| item.split('') }
end

# @param {Character[][]} grid
# @return {Integer}
def num_islands(grid)
    if grid.nil? or grid.length == 0 or grid[0].length == 0
        return 0
    end
    
    m = grid.length
    n = grid[0].length

    count = 0
    a = []

    m.times do |i|
        n.times do |j|
            if grid[i][j] == '1'
                a.push(i*n + j)
                count += 1
            else
                a.push(-1)
            end
        end
    end

    moves = [[0, 1], [1, 0], [0, -1], [-1, 0]]

    m.times do |i|
        n.times do |j|
            if grid[i][j] == '0'
                next
            end

            moves.each do |move|
                x = i + move[0]
                y = j + move[1]

                if x >= 0 and x < m and y >= 0 and y < n and grid[x][y] == '1'
                
                    root_x = find(a, i * n + j)
                    root_y = find(a, x * n + y)
            
                    if root_x != root_y
                        a[root_x] = root_y
                        count -= 1
                    end
                end
            end
        end
    end

    count
end

# test case
test_data = '11110\n' \
       '11010\n' \
       '11000\n' \
       '00000'

grid = generate_input(test_data)
puts num_islands(grid) == 1
```
