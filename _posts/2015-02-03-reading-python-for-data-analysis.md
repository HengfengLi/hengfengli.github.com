Python is a simple and elegant programming language. I was a 
lab demonstrator for a subject in the university. I am quite 
familiar with Python. And even when I did the Google interviews, 
I chose Python as my testing language, and I use it in my research 
as well. It is quite easy to come true an idea. Data analysis is 
an important aspect nowadays not matter in school or industry. So 
it is better to learn some useful skills. 

I got the recommendation from 
[CSE 591 - Data Science (Fall 2014) by Steven Skiena](http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~skiena/591/). 
He is the author of the famous book "Algorithm Design Manual". 
So I trust his recommendations. It is a very important way to search
great books via excellent authors. 

I will record my progress here, sometimes I will write down some 
comments about my experience.
