I found that [heapq](https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/3.5/Lib/heapq.py)'s
**heapify** in Python is not efficient. The **heapify** function
transforms a list into a min-heap. Let's have a look.

~~~python
def heapify(x):
    """Transform list into a heap, in-place, in O(len(x)) time."""
    n = len(x)
    # Transform bottom-up.  The largest index there's any point to looking at
    # is the largest with a child index in-range, so must have 2*i + 1 < n,
    # or i < (n-1)/2.  If n is even = 2*j, this is (2*j-1)/2 = j-1/2 so
    # j-1 is the largest, which is n//2 - 1.  If n is odd = 2*j+1, this is
    # (2*j+1-1)/2 = j so j-1 is the largest, and that's again n//2-1.
    for i in reversed(range(n//2)):
        _siftup(x, i)

def _siftup(heap, pos):
    endpos = len(heap)
    startpos = pos
    newitem = heap[pos]
    # Bubble up the smaller child until hitting a leaf.
    childpos = 2*pos + 1    # leftmost child position
    while childpos < endpos:
        # Set childpos to index of smaller child.
        rightpos = childpos + 1
        if rightpos < endpos and not heap[childpos] < heap[rightpos]:
            childpos = rightpos
        # Move the smaller child up.
        heap[pos] = heap[childpos]
        pos = childpos
        childpos = 2*pos + 1
    # The leaf at pos is empty now.  Put newitem there, and bubble it up
    # to its final resting place (by sifting its parents down).
    heap[pos] = newitem
    _siftdown(heap, startpos, pos)

# 'heap' is a heap at all indices >= startpos, except possibly for pos.  pos
# is the index of a leaf with a possibly out-of-order value.  Restore the
# heap invariant.
def _siftdown(heap, startpos, pos):
    newitem = heap[pos]
    # Follow the path to the root, moving parents down until finding a place
    # newitem fits.
    while pos > startpos:
        parentpos = (pos - 1) >> 1
        parent = heap[parentpos]
        if newitem < parent:
            heap[pos] = parent
            pos = parentpos
            continue
        break
    heap[pos] = newitem
~~~

The above code are the implementation of **heapify**. Here, **\_siftup**
function is similar to the **sift down** operation that I have discussed in my
previous post "[HL-5] Review of heap". It makes **pos** empty and bubbles up
smaller child until meeting a leaf. Next, **\_siftdown** is similar to the
**climb up** operation discussed in [HL-5]. Thus, **heapify** take more time
than just sifting down an item to its correct position.

The original **\_siftup** is not efficient, so we can improve this function
**siftdown** as follows:

~~~python
def heapify(x):
    """Transform list into a heap, in-place, in O(len(x)) time."""
    n = len(x)
    # Transform bottom-up.  The largest index there's any point to looking at
    # is the largest with a child index in-range, so must have 2*i + 1 < n,
    # or i < (n-1)/2.  If n is even = 2*j, this is (2*j-1)/2 = j-1/2 so
    # j-1 is the largest, which is n//2 - 1.  If n is odd = 2*j+1, this is
    # (2*j+1-1)/2 = j so j-1 is the largest, and that's again n//2-1.
    for i in reversed(range(n//2)):
        siftdown(x, i)

def siftdown(heap, pos):
    endpos = len(heap)
    childpos = 2*pos + 1    # leftmost child position
    while childpos < endpos:
        # Set childpos to index of smaller child.
        rightpos = childpos + 1
        if rightpos < endpos and heap[rightpos] < heap[childpos]:
            childpos = rightpos
        if heap[pos] < heap[childpos]:
            break
        # Move the root node down and smaller child up.
        tmp = heap[pos]
        heap[pos] = heap[childpos]
        heap[childpos] = tmp
        pos = childpos
        childpos = 2*pos + 1
~~~

Also, we can change the **\_siftdown** to **climbup** by deleting **startpos**:

~~~python
def climbup(heap, pos):
    newitem = heap[pos]
    # Follow the path to the root, moving parents down until finding a place
    # newitem fits.
    while pos > 0:
        parentpos = (pos - 1) >> 1
        parent = heap[parentpos]
        if newitem < parent:
            heap[pos] = parent
            pos = parentpos
            continue
        break
    heap[pos] = newitem
~~~
