Last weekend, my friend, Guan, and I went to the Ford AppLink Hackathon, which is an valuable 
experience, although it is reaaaaaaaaaally exhausted. Due to our busy research study, we didn't 
spend too much time to prepare it. I just learned the objective-c and iOS programming for 
a week, so that the main contribution comes from Guan who has already programmed on iOS for 
half year. We never did a programming cooperation before and we really enjoy it.

The hackathon place. I really like the chair on that place, which is the zody chair made by Haworth.

The Ford car has two impressive features: one is the automated parking 
system and another is the automated braking system. We tested it and 
it is quite useful.

We never stop to eat! The food is amazing and we eat too much!

After programming for 24 hours, we are completely exhausted.

Did you see the icon {SeePark}? It is designed by myself. I browsed several icons online and come up 
with this simple design. Both of us like it!

Our {SeePark} mainly helps drivers find their cars and also reminder them to renew the meters or ticket
to avoid the fine when they concentrate on some work.

1.   **Find where is your car.**
2.   **Reminder when you should renew it.**
3.   **Share parking information with the community.**

There are some difficult issues, e.g., identifying the parking place inside a building or indoor place detection.

Start to record your place and a time counter.

Stop the counter and identify where is your car.

There is a parking history to let you know where you park recently.

Set up a reminder!

Route you to the location of your car. 

It is a really interesting experience to me. The iOS Programming is fun and you can 
come up with some your own idea, design, implement, and show it to so many audiences. 
You developed app is so close to your life and other people's life. It would be 
really pleasure to have an app that can help people. 

__Learning objective-c and programming on iOS is fun!__
