Continue to my last post. How should we route tasks to different queues in Celery? 

Here is the example: 

<script src="https://gist.github.com/HengfengLi/6b1dcf80c4dcad033bee4b6ea79daa6f.js"></script>

We can specify queue, exchange, routing_key when calling `apply_async`. However, it is very confusing that when calling `apply_async(routing_key='xxx')`, the message goes to the default queue. If you don't set `app.conf.task_default_queue`, it will create a queue with name `celery` for you. 

Actually, the trick is to specify either `queue` or `exchange + routing_key`. I tried the following examples: 

```bash
add.apply_async((1,2)) 
=> default_queue

add.apply_async((1,2), routing_key='moon')
=> default_queue

add.apply_async((1,2), routing_key='sunshine')
=> default_queue

add.apply_async((1,2), exchange='default', routing_key='moon') 
=> moon_queue

add.apply_async((1,2), exchange='default', routing_key='sunshine') 
=> sunshine_queue

add.apply_async((1,2), queue='sunshine') 
=> sunshine_queue

add.apply_async((1,2), queue='moon') 
=> moon_queue
```

So there are two options to route tasks to specific queues in celery: 
* queue
* exchange + routing_key

#### Routing tasks in celery chaining

It is a bit special how to route route tasks in celery chaining. Originally, I thought the following code would work: 

```python
task = chain(add.s(1, 2), div.s(3))
task.apply_async(queue='moon')
```

Unexpectedly, `add` task will go to `moon` queue but `div` task will be forwarded to the `default` queue. What I expect is to route both tasks to `moon` queue. 

I find [an answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14953521/how-to-route-a-chain-of-tasks-to-a-specific-queue-in-celery): 

```python
chain(
    add.s(1, 2).set(queue='moon'),
    div.s(3).set(queue='moon')
).apply_async()
```

Now, all tasks will be forwarded to `moon` queue. It is very inconvenient but this is what it is.
