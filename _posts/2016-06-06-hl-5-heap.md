# What is a heap? 

Heap is a very useful data structure for <font color="red">priority
queues</font>. 

* quickly find minimum or maximum element, even after we add or remove an element from it. 
* a very dynamic data structure similar to a Queue but not in FIFO order. 
* The order is based on the <font color="red">priority</font> property. 

# Structure of a heap

* A complete binary tree
* Meet <font color="red">heap condition</font>: values of children nodes are not greater than that of their parent node. 
* Such as,

* Standard implementation by using an array: 

![](/img/hl-5-heap-array.png)

* A[i] is the parent node of A[2\*i] (left child) and A[2\*i+1] (right child), 
assume that we leave the first element A[0] empty. 
* Then, the <font color="red">heap condition</font> becomes: A[i] <= A[i/2] for all i in [1,...,n-1]. 

# Push a new element

* Insert a new element 30, 

![](/img/hl-5-heap-insert.png)

* First, add it into the first empty position at the end; 
* Then, do <font color="red">"climb up"</font> for the new element, 
until it becomes the root or its value is less than or equal to the 
value of its parent node. 

# Pop the (max) element

* Delete the root (max element), 

![](/img/hl-5-heap-delete.png)

* First, swap the root with the last element; 
* Then, do <font color="red">"sift down"</font> for the root, until 
it becomes a leave or its value is greater than or equal to that of 
its children nodes. 

# Two ways to build a heap

Let's assume that the sequence is 4, 26, 7, 12, 30, 19. 

* Repeatedly insert new element (O(nlogn)): 

![](/img/hl-5-heap-repeat-insert.png)

* A bottom-up approach (O(n)): first, put all elements into the 
complete tree at first; 
* Then, "sift down" every parent node from the last one to the root 
(note: it is incorrect to start from the root, why?).
