Yesterday, I was struggling to buy a domain and web storage. 

When I was trying to install the Wordpress, the staff "cosbeta" of homezz.com 
criticized me a bit. 

It was my first time to use web storage, and I didn't figure out the relationships
of files and folders. After a while, I just got that I have to put the 'wordpress' 
directory into 'public_html'. Then, I met another problem that the domain with 
the prefix "www" can be visited, but the one without "www" cannot be accessed. 
So I asked the service staff and he said "please search it yourself". Yes, I 
was a bit stupid. I went to the domain managing website, and after struggling 
a while, I fixed the problem by myself and the feeling was good. 

I also got the Chinese and English version of my academic transcript. Not very 
hard. The administration system of my college is not very good, which bugs me a lot 
to run many times between several agencies. I heard that other universities can 
have a online system to book the transcript in English with a certain fee. 

I will leave Beihai on 28th, and not too many days remains for my undergraduate 
college. I will go to study aboard soon. It is a pity but also with some  
expectations for my future journeys.
