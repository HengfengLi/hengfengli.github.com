## A scheduled (cron-like) task

This all begins with my need to schedule a script to crawl some stock data weekly.
In a web service or application, we always have some needs to do a job at at fixed
times, dates, or intervals.

The most famous job scheduler is [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron), which
provides a utility for scheduling repetitive tasks on Linux/Unix systems. 
Cron Expression is commonly used to let you define when tasks should be run. You 
can check this website [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) to configure the cron 
expression. There are different variants of Cron Expression used in systems, like 
Jenkins, Kubernetes CronJob, Fargate Scheduled Task etc. Make sure you check its 
instructions before use.

## AWS Fargate

Fargate is a new managed service for container orchestration provided by AWS. In ECS, we 
always need to provision the EC2 cluster first before running services. Also, there 
is an operation cost to maintain the cluster. When there is a change, we need to 
change both the underlying cluster (the number of EC2 instances) and services 
(the number of tasks). In Fargate, you don't need to operate the cluster. You can 
image Fargate as a unlimited cluster that you can use and you pay as you use. 

Fargate also provides the ability to run scheduled tasks via CloudWatch Events. 

There are a couple of other job schedulers: 

- Kubernetes CronJob
- Airflow (using Celery scheduler)
- Jenkins

Kubernetes CronJob needs to operate a Kubernetes cluster (I haven't tried AWS EKS yet). 
Airflow needs to run a machine or a cluster and also is tied to Python. 
Jenkins can be used as a job scheduler but it is not designed for this. 

The major advantages of uisng Fargate I think are:

- No operation code and cost
- Support Docker containers
- Easy for scaling up

Plus, Fargate is an extension to ECS, which I am very familar with.

## Create a Fargate scheduled task

1. Create an empty cluster and a VPC configured with two public subnets.

    a. Install [ECS-CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ECS_CLI_installation.html) first. 

    b. Create a cluster configuration
    ```bash
    ecs-cli configure --cluster tutorial --region us-east-1 \
        --default-launch-type FARGATE --config-name tutorial
    ```
    
    c. Run `ecs-cli up`.

    d. Check that a VPC has a default security group.

2. Create log group, S3 bucket, ECS task execution role, e.g., 

	```yaml
	---
	AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
	Description: >
	  Create S3 bucket.
	Parameters:
	  BucketName:
	    Type: String
	  LogGroupName:
	    Type: String

	Resources:
	  StockDataBucket:
	    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
	    Properties:
	      BucketName: !Ref BucketName
	  EcsTaskExecutionRole:
	    Type: AWS::IAM::Role
	    Properties:
	      AssumeRolePolicyDocument:
	        Version: "2012-10-17"
	        Statement:
	          -
	            Effect: "Allow"
	            Principal:
	              Service:
	                - "ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com"
	            Action:
	              - "sts:AssumeRole"
	      ManagedPolicyArns:
	        - arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy
	      Path: /
	  LogGroup:
	    Type: AWS::Logs::LogGroup
	    Properties:
	      LogGroupName: !Ref LogGroupName
	      RetentionInDays: 3
	```
3. Build & push docker image to AWS ECR.
    
    File `Makefile`:
    ```bash
    build:
    	docker build -t hengfeng/stock-crawler:latest .

    push:
        aws ecr get-login --region us-east-1 > ./ecrlogin.sh
        sed -i -E 's,'"-e none"','""',' ./ecrlogin.sh
        sh ./ecrlogin.sh && rm -rf ./ecrlogin.sh && rm -rf ./ecrlogin.sh-E
        docker tag hengfeng/stock-crawler:latest XXX.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/stock-crawler:${TAG}
        docker push XXX.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/stock-crawler:${TAG}
    ```
4. Deploy ECS task definition.

    File `Makefile`:
    ```bash
    task-definition:
        export TAG=${TAG}
        ecs-cli compose --project-name stock-crawler --file ./deploy/docker-compose.yml --ecs-params ./deploy/ecs-params.yml --region us-east-1 create --launch-type FARGATE
    ```

    File `./deploy/docker-compose.yml`:
    ```yaml
	version: '3'
	services:
	  crawler:
	    image: XXX.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/stock-crawler:${TAG}
	    env_file:
	      - ../.env
	    logging:
	      driver: awslogs
	      options: 
	        awslogs-region: us-east-1
	        awslogs-group: stock-crawler
	        awslogs-stream-prefix: ${TAG}
    ```

    File `./deploy/ecs-params.yml`:
    ```yaml
	version: 1
	task_definition:
	  task_execution_role: {ECS_TASK_EXECUTION_ROLE_NAME}
	  ecs_network_mode: awsvpc
	  task_size:
	    mem_limit: 0.5GB
	    cpu_limit: 256
	run_params:
	  network_configuration:
	    awsvpc_configuration:
	      subnets:
            - {SUBNET_A_NAME}
            - {SUBNET_B_NAME}
          security_groups:
            - {SECURITY_GROUP_NAME}
	      assign_public_ip: ENABLED
    ```
    Note: Replace `ECS_TASK_EXECUTION_ROLE_NAME`, `SUBNET_A_NAME`, `SUBNET_B_NAME`, and `SECURITY_GROUP_NAME` with your parameters.
5. Create a scheduled Fargate task.
    ```yaml
	---
	AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
	Description: >
	  Scheduled ECS task.
	Parameters:
	  ECSClusterArn:
	    Type: String
	  ScheduledWorkerTaskArn:
	    Type: String

	Resources:
	  StockCrawlerTaskSchedule:
	    Type: AWS::Events::Rule
	    Properties:
	      Description: "Crawl stock data every 15 mins"
	      Name: "stock-crawler"
	      ScheduleExpression: "cron(0/15 * * * ? *)"
	      State: DISABLED
	      Targets:
	        - Id: stock-crawler-fargate-task
	          RoleArn: !GetAtt TaskSchedulerRole.Arn
	          Arn: !Ref ECSClusterArn
	          EcsParameters:
	            TaskCount: 1
	            TaskDefinitionArn: !Ref ScheduledWorkerTaskArn
	  TaskSchedulerRole:
	    Type: AWS::IAM::Role
	    Properties:
	      AssumeRolePolicyDocument:
	        Version: "2012-10-17"
	        Statement:
	          -
	            Effect: "Allow"
	            Principal:
	              Service:
	                - "events.amazonaws.com"
	            Action:
	              - "sts:AssumeRole"
	      Path: /
	      Policies:
	        - PolicyDocument:
	            Statement:
	              - Effect: "Allow"
	                Condition:
	                  ArnEquals:
	                    ecs:cluster: !Ref ECSClusterArn
	                Action: "ecs:RunTask"
	                Resource: "*"
	              - Effect: "Allow"
	                Condition:
	                  ArnEquals:
	                    ecs:cluster: !Ref ECSClusterArn
	                Action:
	                  - "iam:ListInstanceProfiles"
	                  - "iam:ListRoles"
	                  - "iam:PassRole"
	                Resource: "*"
	          PolicyName: "TaskSchedulerPolicy"
    ```
    Note: From [EcsParameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchEvents/latest/APIReference/API_EcsParameters.html), CloudFormation in Step 5 should support specify parameters, such as `LaunchType`, `NetworkConfiguration`, `PlatformVersion`, for `Fargate` tasks. However, currently, I don't think it is finished yet because it throws an error saying `keyword` does not exist. This is the reason 
    why I set the task to `DISABLED`.
6. Manually update the task config in CloudWatch Event Rules.

    a. Edit
    - Launch Type: Fargate
    - Platform Version: LATEST
    - Subnets: subnet-001, subnet-002
    - Security Group: sg-001
    - Auto-assign Public IP (MUST): ENABLED
    - Use existing role: TaskSchedulerRole

    b. Enable the task

After the above steps, the task should be run at the schedule in Fargate. The cloudformation 
does not fully support it yet and some manual steps are required.
