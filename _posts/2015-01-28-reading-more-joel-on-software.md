I am reading the book 'More Joel on Software', and I want to write down 
some notes about my journey. I have already read 91 pages, so I start 
from the page 92.

page 92-95: 

I like this sentence in Page 94: 

> Dave Winer says, "To create a usable piece of software, you have to fight

> more person up the curve. There are no shortcuts. Luck is involved, but you
> don't win by being lucky, it happens because you fought for every inch". 

Creating commercial software is "a game of inches". 

It is true that in order to produce a great product, you have to make a tiny bit 
of progress every day. These tiny things will add up to a huge step. It is a simple 
idea, but not everyone can do that. Learning programming and playing guitar are the 
similar things. If you want to be a great programmer or a good fingerstyle player, you 
need to practise it every day to make a tiny progress. Practice makes perfect.
