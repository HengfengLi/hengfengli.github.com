I want to set up two goals for 2015 and not many days remain: 

1.    To read the book "Distributed Algorithms - An Intuitive Approach"; and 

2.    Completing the Udacity's course [Data Wrangling with MongoDB - 
Data Manipulation and Retrieval](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-wrangling-with-mongodb--ud032). 

Wish I can finish them!
