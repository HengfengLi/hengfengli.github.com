# What does `startingDeadlineSeconds` mean?

I was working on Kubernetes CronJob and I was wondering what `startingDeadlineSeconds` is. There 
is an [official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/#cron-job-limitations), but 
I am still confused after reading it. 

After looking at the source code, I think `startingDeadlineSeconds` means that if a CronJob controller cannot start a job run on its schedule, it will keep retrying until `startingDeadlineSeconds` is reached. 

Before showing a few examples, we need to clarify some concepts: 

**Controller check**: CronJob controller checks things (watching and syncing jobs) [every 10 seconds](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/27e5971c11cfcda703a39ed670a565f0f3564713/pkg/controller/cronjob/cronjob_controller.go#L93). 

**Schedule**: the time to execute the job according to the given schedule expression. 

**Job run**: a job object is created about once per execution time of its schedule. 

# Examples

Below, I will use a few examples to demonstrate its use cases.

\#1. Assume that the schedule is 8:30, 9:30, ... and  `startingDeadlineSeconds` is 60 seconds. 
During 8:29-8:35, there is a downtime to start a job run. In this case, the job will not be 
executed because when the system comes back to healthy, the time is 8:35 that is after the deadline 
8:31. The schedule at 8:30 is lost and the next schedule will be at 9:30. 

This is the case when the interval between schedules is greater than `startingDeadlineSeconds`. 
What if it is lesser?

\#2. Assume that the schedule is 8:30, 8:31, 8:32, ..., for every minute and `startingDeadlineSeconds` 
is 2 hours. The downtime is between 8:30 and 10:20. 

What will happen under this case? The CronJob controller will keep trying to start a job according to the most recent schedule. Once the number of schedule misses reaches 100 times, the controller will not 
try to start a job any more and logs the error

```
Cannot determine if job needs to be started. Too many missed start time (> 100). Set or decrease .spec.startingDeadlineSeconds or check clock skew.
```

I also found there are some redundant code that can be cleaned up in this part so that I submitted an issue:
