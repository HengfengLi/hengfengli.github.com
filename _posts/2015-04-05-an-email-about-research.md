著名华人生物学家蒲慕明的一封email。

To all lab members:

致所有实验室的成员：

Over the past several months, it has become clear to me that if there is no drastic change in the lab, Poo lab will soon cease to be a productive, first-rate lab that you chose to join in the first place. Lab progress reports over the past six months have clearly shown the lack of progress in most projects. One year ago, when we first moved to Berkeley, I expressed clearly to everyone my expectation from each one in the lab. The most important thing is what I consider to be sufficient amount of time and effort in the lab work. I mentioned that about 60 hr working time per week is what I consider the minimal time an average successful young scientist in these days has to put into the lab work. There may be a few rare lucky fellows like Florian, who had two Nature papers in his sleeve already, can enjoy life for a while and still get a job offer from Harvard. No one else in the lab has Florian's luxury to play around. 

最近的几个月，我意识到，如果实验室没有重大改变，Poo实验室很快将不会是一个高产的，第一流的实验室，当初你们选择加入的地方。过去六个月的实验室进度报告，清楚地表明大多数项目缺乏进步。一年前，当我们搬去Berkeley，我清楚地对每个人表达了，我对你们的工作期望。我认为最重要的事情是，花费足够的时间和努力在实验室里。我提到了每周大约60工作小时，这是我认为现在大多数成功的年轻科学家必须放在实验室工作的最少工作时间。少量幸运的同事，像Florian的袖子里已经有了两篇Nature的文章，他能享受一下生活，并且从Harvard获得了工作offer。实验室里没有其他人能有Florian的幸运去闲适地工作。

<font color='red'>评注：每周60小时。如果每周工作6天，每天平均10小时。如果每周工作7天，每天平均8.5小时。</font>

Thus I am imposing strict rules in the lab from now on:

因此，从今后在实验室里，我将强制实行一些严格的规定：

1. Every one works at least 50 hr a week in the lab (e.g., 8+ hr a day, six days a week). This is by far lower than what I am doing every day and throughout most of my career. You may be smarter or do not want to be as successful, but I am not asking you to match my time in the lab. 

1. 每个人至少要在实验室中每周工作50小时（例如，每天8+小时，每周六天）。这是远远低于我自己每天的安排，我大多数的生涯一直这样。你可能更聪明或者不想成功，但是，我不是在要求你符合我在实验室的时间安排。

2. By working, I mean real bench work. This does not include surfing on the computer and sending and receiving e-mails for non-scientific matters unrelated to your work (you can do this after work in the labor at home), and excessive chatting on non scientific matters. No long lunch break except special occasions. I suggest that everyone puts in at least 6 hr concentrated bench work and 2+ hr reading and other research-related activity each day. Reading papers and books should bed one mostly after work. More time can be spent on reading, literature search and writing during working hours when you are ready for writing a paper. 

2. 工作，我是说真正的实验台工作。这不包括浏览网页，收发无关科研事宜和与工作无关的邮件（工作后，你可以花时间在家做这件事情），和过度地无关科研事宜的聊天。除非特别场合，不应该有很长的午饭时间。我建议，每个人至少应该花费6小时在集中的实验台工作，另外2+小时用在阅读文章和其他科研相关的活动上。阅读文章和书籍应该放在工作后进行。当你在准备写一篇文章的时候，你可以花更多的工作时间在阅读，文献查找和写作上。

3. I must be informed in person by e-mail (even in my absence from the lab) when you are absent from the lab for a whole day or more. Inform me early your vacation plan. Taking more than 20 working days out of one year is the maximum to me. In fact, none of you are reporting any vacation and sick leave on your time sheet (against the university rule, although I have been signing the sheets), but you know roughly how many days you were not here. 

3. 当你一整天或者更多天不在实验室，你必须私人地以email通知我（即使我不在实验室）。及早地通知我你的假期计划。我认为，一年最多休息20天。事实上，你们当中没有人在时间安排表上，报告任何假期和病假（根据学校的规定，尽管我签署了这些表），但是你大概知道你一年能多少天不在这里。

On the whole, I understand and accept the fact that you may not fulfill the above requirements all the time, due to health reasons, occasional personal business. But if you do not like to follow the rules because it is simply a matter of choice of life style, I respect your choice but suggest you start making plans immediately and leave the lab by the end of January 31. I will do my best to help you to locate a lab to transfer or to find a job. 

总之，我理解和接受你可能无法一直遵循上面的要求，因为健康的原因和偶尔的私人事宜。但是，如果你不愿遵循上面的规定，仅仅是因为这是一件关于生活方式选择的事情。我尊重你的选择，并且建议你立即开始计划在1月31号前离开实验室。我将会尽力帮助你转到其他实验室或者找到一份工作。

If you do accept the conditions I describe above, I am happy to continue to provide my best support to your work, hopefully more than I have done in the past. I will review the progress of everyone in the lab by the end of June of 2002. I expect everyone to have made sufficient progress in the research so that a good paper is in sight (at least to the level of J.Neuroscience). If you cannot meet this goal at that time, I will have to ask you to prepare to leave my lab by the end of August. 

如果你接受了上面我所描述的条件，我很高兴继续为你的工作提供我最好的支持，很可能比我以前所做的更多。在2002年六月底，我将会查看实验室里每各人的进度。我期待每个人都能在科研上有足够的进步，这样能够几乎看到一篇好的文章（至少要是J.Neuroscience的水平）。如果你在那个时候不能达到这个目标，我将会请你在八月底准备离开我的实验室。
