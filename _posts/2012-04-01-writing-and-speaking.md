Paul Graham是硅谷著名的创业导师，Lisp程序员，风险投资家。他创建了Y Combinator投资公司，给创业者予以早期的帮助，是创业者的温床。我想应该算是天使投资了吧，在早期投资项目，给予少量的资金，帮助其实现创业梦想。我读过他的《黑客与画家》，里面让我印象非常深刻的就是在他的鼓动下，让人对Lisp的跃跃欲试。我记得他在里面写了9个Lisp超前的编程特性，非常了不起。确实，我已将Lisp加入到我以后必将学的语言之一。近日闲来无事，发现他网站上有很多文章，试着翻译一下，不足之处，还请见谅。

<h2 style="text-align:center;">WRITING AND SPEAKING</h2>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">写作和演讲</h2>

I'm not a very good speaker. I say "um" a lot. Sometimes I have to pause when I lose my train of thought. I wish I were a better speaker. But I don't wish I were a better speaker like I wish I were a better writer. What I really want is to have good ideas, and that's a much bigger part of being a good writer than being a good speaker.

我不是一个善于演讲的人。在演讲的时候，我会说很多的"um"。有时候，由于没有思路了，我不得不停下来。我很希望我能成为一个更好的演讲者。但是，我想成为一个更好的写作家的愿望更加强烈。其实，我真正想要的是拥有更好的想法，与成为一个好的演讲者相比，成为一个好的写作家需要拥有更好的想法。

Having good ideas is most of writing well. If you know what you're talking about, you can say it in the plainest words and you'll be perceived as having a good style. With speaking it's the opposite: having good ideas is an alarmingly small component of being a good speaker.

好的写作大多是因为拥有好的想法。如果你知道谈论的是什么，你能用最平常的语言表达出来，你将会被认为有一个很好的风格。而演讲则是截然不同的，拥有好的想法只是成为一个好的演讲者非常小的要素。

I first noticed this at a conference several years ago. There was another speaker who was much better than me. He had all of us roaring with laughter. I seemed awkward and halting by comparison. Afterward I put my talk online like I usually do. As I was doing it I tried to imagine what a transcript of the other guy's talk would be like, and it was only then I realized he hadn't said very much.

我第一次注意到它，是在几年前的一个会议上。另外一个比我好的演讲者，它使得我们大家捧腹大笑。做起比较的话，我似乎是笨拙的，而且结结巴巴的。之后，就像往常一样，我把自己的讲话放在网上。当我在做这个的时候，我尝试着想象另一个人演讲的文字整理稿应该是什么样的，只有到那个时候，我才意识到他并没有讲很多内容。

Maybe this would have been obvious to someone who knew more about speaking, but it was a revelation to me how much less ideas mattered in speaking than writing. \[1\]

对于某些很了解演讲的人来说，这是可能非常明显的事情。但是，对于我来说，这是一次意外的发现，演讲所需要的想法比写作少。\[1\]

A few years later I heard a talk by someone who was not merely a better speaker than me, but a famous speaker. Boy was he good. So I decided I'd pay close attention to what he said, to learn how he did it. After about ten sentences I found myself thinking "I don't want to be a good speaker."

几年之后，我听说了某人有一个演讲，他不仅是一个比我更好的演讲者，而且是一位非常有名的演讲者，他非常优秀。所以，我决定会集中注意力去听取他在讲些什么，去学习他是如何做到的。在听了大约十句话之后，我发现“自己并不想成为一名好的演讲者“。

Being a really good speaker is not merely orthogonal to having good ideas, but in many ways pushes you in the opposite direction. For example, when I give a talk I usually write it out beforehand. I know that's a mistake; I know delivering a prewritten talk makes it harder to engage with an audience. The way to get the attention of an audience is to give them your full attention, and when you're delivering a prewritten talk your attention is always divided between the audience and the talk—even if you've memorized it. If you want to engage an audience it's better to start with no more than an outline of what you want to say and ad lib the individual sentences. But if you do that you could spend no more time thinking about each sentence than it takes to say it. \[2\] Occasionally the stimulation of talking to a live audience makes you think of new things, but in general this is not going to generate ideas as well as writing does, where you can spend as long on each sentence as you want.

成为一个非常好的演讲者，不仅与拥有好的想法没有关系，甚至在许多方面，导致你走向相反的方向。例如，当我要发表一个演讲的时候，我通常会事先将它写出来。我知道这是一个错误的做法；我知道发表预先写好的演讲很难吸引一个观众。吸引一个观众的注意力的方法，是给予他们你全部的注意力。当你在发表一个预先写好的演讲，你的注意力总是分散在观众和演讲之间——即使你已经记住了演讲稿。如果你想吸引一个观众，更好的做法是，只是列出一个你想要说的内容的提纲，然后，在演讲中即兴地说出每句话。但是，如果你这样做的话，你几乎没有时间去思考你将要说的每一句话。\[2\] 偶尔，和一个现场观众有趣的对话，会使得你思考一些新的事情。但是，这并不会像写作一下产生好的想法，因为在写作中，你可以花更多的时间在每句话上。

If you rehearse a prewritten speech enough, you can get asymptotically close to the sort of engagement you get when speaking ad lib. Actors do. But here again there's a tradeoff between smoothness and ideas. All the time you spend practicing a talk, you could instead spend making it better. Actors don't face that temptation except in the rare cases where they've written the script, but any speaker does. Before I give a talk I can usually be found sitting in a corner somewhere with a copy printed out on paper, trying to rehearse it in my head. But I always end up spending most of the time rewriting it instead. Every talk I give ends up being given from a manuscript full of things crossed out and rewritten. Which of course makes me um even more, because I haven't had any time at all to practice the new bits. [3]

如果你能把一个预先写好的演讲排练的很好，你就能够非常接近你即兴演讲时的吸引力。演员就是这样的。但是，这里再次遇到一个需要权衡的地方，流畅性和想法。你练习演讲所花费的时间，其实可以用来使演讲变得更好。演员没有这个机会去修改剧本，除非在很少的情况下，剧本是他们写的，但是，每一个演讲者都可以这样做。在我演讲之前，通常可以发现我坐在某一个角落里，拿着一份打印的纸，试图在我的脑海中练习。但是，最终的结果通常是，我花费了更多的时间在修改它。每次演讲都会以一个满是划掉和重写的手稿而告终。这样当然让我说了更多的"um"，因为我根本没有时间去练习新的东西。

Depending on your audience, there are even worse tradeoffs than these. Audiences like to be flattered; they like jokes; they like to be swept off their feet by a vigorous stream of words. As you decrease the intelligence of the audience, being a good speaker is increasingly a matter of being a good bullshitter. That's true in writing too of course, but the descent is steeper with talks. Any given person is dumber as a member of an audience than as a reader. Just as a speaker ad libbing can only spend as long thinking about each sentence as it takes to say it, a person hearing a talk can only spend as long thinking about each sentence as it takes to hear it. Plus people in an audience are always affected by the reactions of those around them, and the reactions that spread from person to person in an audience are disproportionately the more brutish sort, just as low notes travel through walls better than high ones. Every audience is an incipient mob, and a good speaker uses that. Part of the reason I laughed so much at the talk by the good speaker at that conference was that everyone else did. [4]

根据观众的不同，可能会有更糟糕的权衡。观众喜欢被夸奖，喜欢笑话，他们喜欢被一番活跃的话语而弄得激动起来。如果你轻视了观众的智商，那么成为一个好的演讲者可能会变成成为一个好的哄骗者。当然，在写作中也如此，但演讲会下降地更快。对于任何人来说，与作为一个读者相比，作为一个观众更容易变得愚蠢。因为一个演讲者的即兴表演，几乎是毫无思考的脱口而出，而听演讲的人也没有花什么时间去思考他听到的每句话。而且，观众总是容易受到周围的人反应的影响，这种传播于观众中的反应大量地散播开来，正如低音符能比高音符更好地穿透墙壁。每一个观众都是早期的暴徒，一个好的演讲者正是利用了这一点。我之所以会，如此嘲笑会议上一个好的演讲者的演讲的部分原因，就是其他的人都这样做了。

So are talks useless? They're certainly inferior to the written word as a source of ideas. But that's not all talks are good for. When I go to a talk, it's usually because I'm interested in the speaker. Listening to a talk is the closest most of us can get to having a conversation with someone like the president, who doesn't have time to meet individually with all the people who want to meet him.

所以，所有的谈话都没有用吗?在作为想法的源泉方面，它们确实比书面语要差一些。然而，并不是所有的讲话都值得去听。当我去听一个人的讲话，通常是因为我对演讲者很感兴趣。这是一个获得与他交谈的好机会，就像总统一样，他没有时间去见每一想要见他的人。

Talks are also good at motivating me to do things. It's probably no coincidence that so many famous speakers are described as motivational speakers. That may be what public speaking is really for. It's probably what it was originally for. The emotional reactions you can elicit with a talk can be a powerful force. I wish I could say that force was more often used for good than ill, but I'm not sure.

讲话同样激励着我做一些事情。将这么多著名的演讲者作为鼓舞人心的演讲者，可能并不是巧合。因为这正是公开演讲的目的所在，这也可能是最初的目的。讲话让你引起的情绪反应，是一股强大的力量。我很希望，我可以说这股力量更多地被用在好的地方，而不是不好的地方，但是，我并不确定。

### Notes

\[1\] I'm not talking here about academic talks, which are a different type of thing. While the audience at an academic talk might appreciate a joke, they will (or at least should) make a conscious effort to see what new ideas you're presenting.

\[1\] 我在这里不没有指学术演讲，这是不同类型的事情。在学术演讲中，观众可能会欣赏一个效果，但是他们将会（至少是应该）努力去发现你在呈现什么新的想法。

\[2\] That's the lower bound. In practice you can often do better, because talks are usually about things you've written or talked about before, and when you ad lib you end up reproducing some of those sentences. Like early medieval architecture, impromptu talks are made of spolia. Which feels a bit dishonest, incidentally, because you have to deliver these sentences as if you'd just thought of them.

\[2\] 这是下限。在实际中，你能经常做得更好，因为交流通常是你已经写过的事情，或者之前已经交谈过的，你的即兴演讲最终只是重新再现其中一些的句子而已。就像中世纪早期的结构，即兴演讲只是重新利用。

\[3\] Robert Morris points out that there is a way in which practicing talks makes them better: reading a talk out loud can expose awkward parts. I agree and in fact I read most things I write out loud at least once for that reason.

\[3\] Robert Morris指出有一种可以通过练习演讲，使得演讲变得更好的方法：大声地读出一个演讲，可以暴露出糟糕的部分。我同意，事实上，我大声朗读大多数我所写的东西，正是由于这个原因。

\[4\] For sufficiently small audiences, it may not be true that being part of an audience makes people dumber. The real decline seems to set in when the audience gets too big for the talk to feel like a conversation—maybe around 10 people.

\[4\] 对于足够少的观众，作为观众会使得人更加笨拙，这个说法可能不正确。真正的下降似乎发生在，当观众觉得人太多，而想要一个10个人左右的交谈。
