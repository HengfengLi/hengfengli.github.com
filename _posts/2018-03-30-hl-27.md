This is a summary for git workflow management, which is an important part
when having a team working together with git. There are several approaches
to manage the workflow:

* All in master branch
* Feature branch
* GitFlow
* GitHub flow
* GitLab flow

# All in master branch

Simple. Everything is a single master branch.

```bash
# git pull [remote repository] [branch]
$ git pull origin master
$ git commit
$ git push origin master
```

`git pull` is a shorthand of `git fetch` and `git merge FETCH_HEAD`.
`git merge` to merge the retrieved branch heads into the current branch.

```
     A---B---C master on origin
    /
D---E---F---G master
    ^
    origin/master in your repository
```

After `git pull`,

```
D---E---F---G---A---B---C---H master
                            ^
                            fix merge issue
```
