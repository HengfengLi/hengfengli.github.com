This is a summary for git workflow management, which is an important part
when having a team working together with git. There are several approaches
to manage the workflow:

- [All in master branch](#all-in-master-branch)
- [Feature branch](#feature-branch)
- [GitFlow](#gitflow)
- [GitHub flow](#github-flow)
- [GitLab flow](#gitlab-flow)

# All in master branch

Simple. Everything is a single master branch.

```bash
# git pull [remote repository] [branch]
$ git pull origin master
$ git commit
$ git push origin master
```

`git pull` is a shorthand of `git fetch` and `git merge FETCH_HEAD`.
`git merge` to merge the retrieved branch heads into the current branch.

```
     A---B---C master on origin
    /
D---E---F---G master
    ^
    origin/master in your repository
```

To merge these two branches, there are two ways to do that, `git pull` and
`git pull --rebase`. However, we should note that there is a big difference
between them. After `git pull`,

```
D---E---F---G---A---B---C---H master
                            ^
                            fix merge issue
```

After `git pull --rebase`,

```
D---E---A---B---C---F---G master
```

If there is a conflict between `C` and `F`, you need to resolve it and
use `git add` to mark them as resolved. Then, run `git rebase --continue`
to continue to apply `G`.

This is an important difference between `git merge` and `git rebase`.
I didn't really understand it until I made some experiments to verify it today.

# Feature branch

This is the workflow in my current company.

```bash
$ git checkout -b feature/new-branch
$ git add .
$ git commit
```

When you want to add a feature or
fix a bug, you first checkout a local branch.
