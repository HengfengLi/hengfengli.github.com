This is a summary for git workflow management, which is an important part
when having a team working together with git. There are several approaches
to manage the workflow:

- [All in master branch](#all-in-master-branch)
- [Feature branch](#feature-branch)
- [GitFlow](#gitflow)
- [GitHub flow](#github-flow)
- [GitLab flow](#gitlab-flow)

# All in master branch

Simple. Everything is a single master branch.

```bash
# git pull [remote repository] [branch]
$ git pull origin master
$ git commit
$ git push origin master
```

`git pull` is a shorthand of `git fetch` and `git merge FETCH_HEAD`.
`git merge` to merge the retrieved branch heads into the current branch.

```
     A---B---C master on origin
    /
D---E---F---G master
    ^
    origin/master in your repository
```

To merge these two branches, there are two ways to do that, `git pull` and
`git pull --rebase`. However, we should note that there is a big difference
between them. After `git pull`,

```
D---E---F---G---A---B---C---H master
                            ^
                            fix merge issue
```

After `git pull --rebase`,

```
D---E---A---B---C---F---G master
```

If there is a conflict between `C` and `F`, you need to resolve it and
use `git add` to mark them as resolved. Then, run `git rebase --continue`
to continue to apply `G`.

This is an important difference between `git merge` and `git rebase`.
I didn't really understand it until I made some experiments to verify it today.

# Feature branch

This is the workflow in my current company.

```bash
$ git checkout -b feature/new-branch
$ git add .
$ git commit
# create a remote branch in repository
$ git push --set-upstream origin feature/new-branch
```

When you want to add a feature or fix a bug, you first checkout a local branch.
You make changes locally and push them to a remote branch, not master branch.
When you feel it's ready, you can make a pull request to merge your branch into
master branch. After the code review, your code will be merged and deployed.

This approach is simple and works well with small teams. One thing is that
we try to keep changes small and iterate fast, instead of having many changes
in once.

# GitFlow

GitFlow is a famous one. It looks like the following:

Basically, you have to maintain 5 types of branches:

* Master: Stable, direct to production.
* Develop: Unstable, all feature changes will be pushed here.
* Feature: Check out from `Develop` branch, and push changes back to it.
* Hotfix: Check out from `Master`, push changes to `Master` and `Develop`.
* Release: Semi-stable, ready to release, following with a few bugfixes.
Checkout from `Develop` and push to both `Master` and `Develop`.

The drawbacks are obvious because you have to maintain a `Develop` branch
in long-term. Also, changes in `Hotfix` and `Release` need to push to both
`Master` and `Develop` for sync. The git history would look very messy and
hard to follow.

# GitHub flow

This is also called Forking Workflow, which is largely used in open source
projects. Instead of having a central codebase, every developer can have
their own server-side repository. This is the way how we contribute to open
source projects in GitHub.

1. Create a fork of the project under your account
2. Pull the code to your local dev via `git clone`
3. Create a feature branch
4. Save and push changes to your remote forked repo
5. Open up a pull request for your feature branch to the original repo

To me, this looks like a distributed version of feature branch workflow.
The good thing is that only project maintainers have the write permissions
to the official codebase. The contributions can be from any developer, but
merging with the approval from the project maintainer.

# GitLab flow

This is a version used by GitLab with an improvement from GitHub flow,
setting up environment branches, such as `pre-production` and `production`,
or release branches, such as `2.3.stable` and `2.4.stable`.

# Summary

No matter which one you are using, find one that suits your team best.
I believe instead of spending too much time on choosing right git workflow,
it's more worthing to spend time on adjusting team size, split into small
repositories, developing CI/CD, and etc. This makes iteration faster and
easy to cooperate.
