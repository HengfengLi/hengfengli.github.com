Different containers have different efficiencies for certain operations.

The best example compares two types of <strong>List</strong>: and <strong>ArrayList</strong> and a <strong>LinkedList</strong>.

Randomly accessing elements in an <strong>ArrayList</strong> is a constant-time operation; it takes the same amount of time regardless of the element you select. However, in a <strong>LinkedList</strong> it is expensive to move through the list to randomly select an element, and it takes longer to find an element that is farther down the list.

On the other hand, if you want to insert an element in the middle of a sequence, it's cheaper in a <strong>LinkedList</strong> than in an <strong>ArrayList</strong>.
