Today, I did my first onsite interview, but I didn't get the offer. 
It is a pity that I didn't perform very well. I want to make a 
summary for my interview experience this time. So first I will introduce
the whole procedure, and then talk a bit about where I didn't perform 
well (I won't expose the questions), give a summary about which points I 
should improve in my future interviews. 

There are five people to interview together and each of us has three
round interviews. First issue is the language problem. I am the only 
asian and others are native speakers, 
so I guess I lose marks on the communication skills. Then, the second 
issue is the choice of programming language. Interviewers
come from Operating System and Offices groups. I am a bit stupid to say
that I haven't written C for a long time and I want to write my code 
in Python. This is the biggest mistake I made during this interview. 
Although the recruiter claim that you can use any language during the 
interview, the interviewers prefer C, C++, and C#. The first interviewer
directly gave the C function definition, so it means that he asked me 
to write in C. Also, when I asked the second interviewer "can I write in
Python", the answer is no. The third interviewer firmly believes that 
C manages the world (I also believe it too). 

I did really bad in my third interview, because I guess the interviewer 
misunderstood my idea. He thought I am trying to use a very poor 
brute-force solution to solve the problem. But I believe my idea is 
similar to his. He explained his idea to me at the end, but I didn't 
see any difference. This makes him think that I haven't realized my 
mistakes. A worse case happened. Of course, under the time pressure, 
I wrote a messy code in Python, which makes the interviewer lose 
his patience. Two mistakes I made here are that I didn't explain 
my idea clearly (when I am thinking and drafting my idea on the 
whiteboard, the interviewer was looking at his mobile phone) and 
I didn't calm down to write clean code (my messy solution needs
to be simplified). 

Three things I learnt from this experience: 

1.   Improve communication skills. 

2.   Choose the right programming language. 

3.   Have a clear logic in your mind before coding. 

Compared to the Google phone interviews I did last year, I think this
time I am more confident on handling technical problems (obviously, 
this is not enough). The issue is when I meet a new problem, I need 
to think it clearly before writing the code. Otherwise, I write awful
code. Algorithms, data structures, and coding on paper or whiteboard 
are all important to do a good interview. I need more practice.
