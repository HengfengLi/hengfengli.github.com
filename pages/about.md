## My Introduction

`Name:` Hengfeng

`Location:` Melbourne, Australia 

Crazy about the programming, espeically when I enter a state of full involvement which is called "Flow" in pyschology. I used Windows and Ubuntu Linux before, but now I am a big fan of Mac's stuff.

When I was a child, I didn't like reading and writing. I, however, do really love reading and writing and I guess my major has an important impact on me.

`Fields I'm interested in:`

*   Web front-end techniques
*   Text analysis, data mining, recommender system
*   Distributed computing, large scale data processing

`Software I use:`

*   OS: Mac OS X 10.7 Lion.
*   Editor: Vim, Sublime Text 2, Textmate

`Programming language I learn:`

*   Good: C | Java | JavaScript | LaTeX
*   Middle：Ruby on Rails | Scheme | Haskell | C Sharp | jQuery | Python
*   Newbie：Scala | CoffeeScript | Node.js | Ajax

(BTW, comparing with Ruby and Haskell, even JavaScript, I find Java is so complicated and boring.)
